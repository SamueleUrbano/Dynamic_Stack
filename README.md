      Dynamic array LIFO queue implementation (Stack).
      
      Implements all stack methods (push(), pop()), utility methods and 
      permits all objects, including null. This class provides methods to 
      manipulate the size of the array that is used internally to store the
      stack.

      Each Stack instance has a capacity. The capacity is the size of the array 
      used to store the elements in the stack. As elements are added to a 
      Stack, its capacity grows automatically.
